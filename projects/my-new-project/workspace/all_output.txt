Based on the requirements, we can identify the following core classes, functions, and methods for the snake game:

1. `Game`: Responsible for managing the game state, including the game board, snake, and food.
   - `start()`: Starts the game loop.
   - `update()`: Updates the game state on each iteration of the game loop.
   - `draw()`: Renders the game board and entities on the screen.
   - `handle_input()`: Handles user input for controlling the snake.
   - `check_collision()`: Checks for collisions between the snake and the food or game boundaries.
   - `game_over()`: Handles the game over condition.

2. `Snake`: Represents the snake entity in the game.
   - `move()`: Moves the snake in the specified direction.
   - `grow()`: Increases the length of the snake when it eats food.
   - `check_self_collision()`: Checks for collisions between the snake's head and its body.

3. `Food`: Represents the food entity in the game.
   - `generate()`: Generates a new food item at a random position on the game board.

Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

**game.py**
```python
import pygame

class Game:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.game_over = False

    def start(self):
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()

        while not self.game_over:
            self.update()
            self.draw()
            self.handle_input()
            self.check_collision()
            self.clock.tick(10)

        pygame.quit()

    def update(self):
        self.snake.move()

    def draw(self):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        self.snake.draw(self.screen)
        self.food.draw(self.screen)
        pygame.display.update()

    def handle_input(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                self.game_over = True
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    self.snake.change_direction("UP")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    self.snake.change_direction("DOWN")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    self.snake.change_direction("LEFT")
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    self.snake.change_direction("RIGHT")

    def check_collision(self):
        if self.snake.check_self_collision() or self.snake.check_boundary_collision(self.width, self.height):
            self.game_over = True

        if self.snake.head_position() == self.food.position:
            self.snake.grow()
            self.food.generate()
```

**snake.py**
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(0, 0)]
        self.direction = "RIGHT"

    def move(self):
        # Logic to move the snake based on the current direction
        pass

    def draw(self, screen):
        # Logic to draw the snake on the screen
        pass

    def change_direction(self, direction):
        # Logic to change the direction of the snake
        pass

    def check_self_collision(self):
        # Logic to check if the snake's head collides with its body
        pass

    def check_boundary_collision(self, width, height):
        # Logic to check if the snake collides with the game boundaries
        pass

    def head_position(self):
        # Returns the position of the snake's head
        pass

    def grow(self):
        # Logic to increase the length of the snake
        pass
```

**food.py**
```python
class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = (0, 0)

    def generate(self):
        # Logic to generate a new food item at a random position
        pass

    def draw(self, screen):
        # Logic to draw the food on the screen
        pass
```

**test_game.py**
```python
import pytest
from game import Game

def test_game_start():
    game = Game(800, 600)
    game.start()
    assert game.game_over == True
```

**requirements.txt**
```
pygame==2.0.1
```

In this implementation, we have split the snake game logic into separate files: `game.py`, `snake.py`, and `food.py`. The entry point of the game is the `Game` class in `game.py`, which manages the game state, updates the game loop, handles user input, and checks for collisions. The `Snake` class in `snake.py` represents the snake entity and handles its movement, drawing, and collision detection. The `Food` class in `food.py` represents the food entity and handles its generation and drawing.

Additionally, we have included a test file `test_game.py` that tests the `start()` method of the `Game` class using the `pytest` framework.

The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependency on `pygame` library, which is required for rendering the game graphics.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of the snake game and may require further enhancements and error handling based on specific requirements.
