Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the Snake game:

1. `Game`: Responsible for managing the game state, updating the game logic, and handling user input.
   - `start()`: Starts the game loop.
   - `update()`: Updates the game state.
   - `handle_input()`: Handles user input.
   - `draw()`: Draws the game board and entities.

2. `Snake`: Represents the snake entity in the game.
   - `move()`: Moves the snake in the current direction.
   - `change_direction()`: Changes the direction of the snake based on user input.
   - `grow()`: Increases the length of the snake when it eats food.
   - `check_collision()`: Checks for collisions with walls and itself.

3. `Food`: Represents the food entity in the game.
   - `generate()`: Generates a new food at a random position on the game board.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
