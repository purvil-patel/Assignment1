`check_collision()`: Checks for collisions with walls and itself.\n\n3. `Food`: Represents the food entity in the game.\n   - `generate()`: Generates a new food at a random position on the game board.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.\n\n**game.py**\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom snake import Snake\nfrom food import Food\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.width = 640\n        self.height = 480\n        self.snake = Snake()\n        self.food = Food()\n        self.game_over = False\n\n    def start(self):\n        pygame.init()\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.width, self.height))\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Snake Game\")\n        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n\n        while not self.game_over:\n            self.update()\n            self.handle_input()\n            self.draw()\n            self.clock.tick(10)\n\n        pygame.quit()\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.snake.move()\n        self.snake.check_collision(self.width, self.height)\n        if self.snake.collides_with(self.food):\n            self.snake.grow()\n            self.food.generate()\n\n    def handle_input(self):\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                self.game_over = True\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:\n                    self.snake.change_direction(\"UP\")\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:\n                    self.snake.change_direction(\"DOWN\")\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n                    self.snake.change_direction(\"LEFT\")\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n                    self.snake.change_direction(\"RIGHT\")\n\n    def draw(self):\n        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n        self.snake.draw(self.screen)\n        self.food.draw(self.screen)\n        pygame.display.update()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game = Game()\n    game.start()\n```\n\n**snake.py**\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Snake:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.size = 1\n        self.block_size = 20\n        self.speed = self.block_size\n        self.direction = \"RIGHT\"\n        self.body = [(self.block_size, self.block_size)]\n\n    def move(self):\n        x, y = self.body[0]\n        if self.direction == \"UP\":\n            y -= self.speed\n        elif self.direction == \"DOWN\":\n            y += self.speed\n        elif self.direction == \"LEFT\":\n            x -= self.speed\n        elif self.direction == \"RIGHT\":\n            x += self.speed\n        self.body.insert(0, (x, y))\n        if len(self.body) > self.size:\n            self.body.pop()\n\n    def change_direction(self, direction):\n        if direction == \"UP\" and self.direction != \"DOWN\":\n            self.direction = direction\n        elif direction == \"DOWN\" and self.direction != \"UP\":\n            self.direction = direction\n        elif direction == \"LEFT\" and self.direction != \"RIGHT\":\n            self.direction = direction\n        elif direction == \"RIGHT\" and self.direction != \"LEFT\":\n            self.direction = direction\n\n    def grow(self):\n        self.size += 1\n\n    def check_collision(self, width, height):\n        x, y = self.body[0]\n        if x < 0 or x >= width or y < 0 or y >= height:\n            pygame.quit()\n            raise Exception(\"Game Over: Collision with walls\")\n        if self.body[0] in self.body[1:]:\n            pygame.quit()\n            raise Exception(\"Game Over: Collision with itself\")\n\n    def collides_with(self, other):\n        return self.body[0] == other.position\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        for x, y in self.body:\n            pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 255, 0), (x, y, self.block_size, self.block_size))\n\n```\n\n**food.py**\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport random\n\nclass Food:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.block_size = 20\n        self.position = (0, 0)\n        self.generate()\n\n    def generate(self):\n        x = random.randint(0, 31) * self.block_size\n        y = random.randint(0, 23) * self.block_size\n        self.position = (x, y)\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), (self.position[0], self.position[1], self.block_size, self.block_size))\n```\n\n**requirements.txt**\n```\npygame==2.0.1\n```\n\nThe code is now organized into separate files based on the MVC architecture.
