The entry point of the game is the `Game` class in `game.py`, which manages the game state, updates the game loop, handles user input, and checks for collisions. The `Snake` class in `snake.py` represents the snake entity and handles its movement, drawing, and collision detection. The `Food` class in `food.py` represents the food entity and handles its generation and drawing.\n\nAdditionally, we have included a test file `test_game.py` that tests the `start()` method of the `Game` class using the `pytest` framework.\n\nThe `requirements.txt` file lists the dependency on `pygame` library, which is required for rendering the game graphics.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation of the snake game and may require further enhancements and error handling based on specific requirements.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "To install the dependencies and run the codebase, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.
