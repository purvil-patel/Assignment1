Based on the requirements and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the calculator application:

1. Model:
   - Calculator: Responsible for performing calculations and storing the current state of the calculator.
     - add(num1, num2): Adds two numbers.
     - subtract(num1, num2): Subtracts num2 from num1.
     - multiply(num1, num2): Multiplies two numbers.
     - divide(num1, num2): Divides num1 by num2.
     - exponentiate(base, exponent): Raises the base to the power of the exponent.
     - sin(angle): Calculates the sine of an angle.
     - cos(angle): Calculates the cosine of an angle.
     - tan(angle): Calculates the tangent of an angle.
     - log(base, num): Calculates the logarithm of a number with a given base.
     - clear(): Resets the calculator state.
     - get_result(): Returns the current result of the calculator.

2. View:
   - CalculatorView: Responsible for displaying the calculator interface and handling user input/output.
     - show_menu(): Displays the calculator menu.
     - get_user_input(): Gets user input from the keyboard.
     - display_result(result): Displays the result of a calculation.
     - display_error(message): Displays an error message.

3. Controller:
   - CalculatorController: Responsible for handling user input, communicating with the Model and View, and controlling the flow of the application.
     - start(): Starts the calculator application.
     - handle_input(input): Handles user input and performs the corresponding action.
     - perform_calculation(operation, num1, num2): Calls the appropriate method in the Model to perform the calculation.
     - display_result(result): Calls the View to display the result.
     - display_error(message): Calls the View to display an error message.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
